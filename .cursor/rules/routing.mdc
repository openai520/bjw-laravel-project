This project uses standard Laravel routing defined in the `routes/` directory.

**Key Route Files:**
*   **Web Routes:** [routes/web.php](mdc:routes/web.php) defines routes for both the user-facing frontend and the admin backend.
*   **API Routes:** [routes/api.php](mdc:routes/api.php) defines routes for API endpoints, currently used for cart summary.

**Route Groups & Prefixes:**
*   **Frontend Routes:**
    *   Prefixed with a language code: `/{lang}/...` (e.g., `/en/products`)
    *   Managed by `Route::prefix('{lang}')...` in [routes/web.php](mdc:routes/web.php).
    *   Uses the `frontend.` route name prefix.
    *   Handled by controllers in [app/Http/Controllers/Frontend/](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/Frontend).
    *   Uses the `setLocale` middleware ([app/Http/Middleware/SetLocale.php](mdc:app/Http/Middleware/SetLocale.php)).
*   **Admin Routes:**
    *   Prefixed with `/admin/...`
    *   Managed by `Route::prefix('admin')...` in [routes/web.php](mdc:routes/web.php).
    *   Uses the `admin.` route name prefix.
    *   Handled by controllers in [app/Http/Controllers/Admin/](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/Admin).
    *   Protected by `auth` and `admin` middleware ([app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php](mdc:app/Http/Middleware/AdminMiddleware.php)).
*   **API Routes:**
    *   Prefixed with `/api/...`
    *   Defined in [routes/api.php](mdc:routes/api.php).
    *   Uses the `api.` route name prefix.

**Middleware:**
*   Global and route middleware are defined in [app/Http/Kernel.php](mdc:app/Http/Kernel.php). Key custom middleware includes `BlockIpMiddleware`, `LogVisitor`, `AdminMiddleware`, `SetLocale`.
